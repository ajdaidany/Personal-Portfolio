<!--the "class" tag works a lot like the "id" tag, except it's helpful to use for a whole class
of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left
of the page.-->

    <p><h3>PROJECT #1</h3></br>This project was a flarf poem, based on the last thing we texted somebody. In my case, that phrase was "Saturn is my favorite planet."

    <p><h3>PROJECT #2</h3></br>Project 2 Greenscreen was a fun project, and what I used for my green screen was recording a video from the CTA green line in downtown, camera not panning, just looking out the window. My passion for photography was allowed to shine through this project.

  <div class="text_right">
    <p><h3>PROJECT #3</h3></br>Project 3 was completely different than the other projects. This project was writing based, as we had to create a nonlinear story game through Twine. My story was the odd story of two highschoolers who discovered that their lives were not normal - nor was their school.
